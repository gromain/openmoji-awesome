### Usage

#### Basic Usage

Add the main files `openmoji-color-awesome.css` and `openmoji-black-awesome.css` to your project and then simply use the following in your HTML source:

`<i class="oma oma-face-with-monocle"></i>`

#### Size Options

Like in Font-Awesome, emoji sizes can be changed via `oma-lg`, `oma-bg`, `oma-2x`, `oma-3x`, `oma-4x`, and `oma-5x`.

#### Finding Emojis

- Openmoji-awesome uses [Openmoji json data](https://github.com/hfg-gmuend/openmoji/blob/master/data/openmoji.json) as its source of codepoints and descriptions.
- To find an emoji of your liking, check out the [Openmoji emoji list](https://openmoji.org/library/). Replace spaces with hyphens to get the class name! (e.g. "man in suit levitating" becomes `oma-man-in-suit-levitating` or `oma-black-man-in-suit-levitating` ðŸ•´)

To use on your website, it is advised to download the svg files here: https://github.com/hfg-gmuend/openmoji/releases/tag/13.1.0 .
By default, the script will generate a css file that will uses the emoji distributed from jsdeliver CDN.


#### Running the generator

`./gradlew run` will generate a fresh version of both the `openmoji-color-awesome.css` and the `openmoji-black-awesome.css` file in the root directory of the project.

The script source can be found in `src/main/kotlin/Main.kt` if you want to customize the image path (Change `openmojiColorUrl` and `openmojiBlackUrl` to the URL you want to use as a source).

You can integrate those in your project to use either color or black and white (or both!) emojis from Openmoji.
